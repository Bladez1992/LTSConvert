# LTSConvert
A Powershell script to convert any 64-bit installation of Windows 10 to IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021 (EOL = January 13, 2032) without data loss - for those who want to avoid switching to Windows 11 and keep receiving updates on 10

The script has been tested and works on Windows 10 Home, Pro, and Education - but it should work on any 64-bit edition of Windows 10 because of the way it functions
